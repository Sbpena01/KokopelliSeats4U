# KokopelliSeats4U
This is Team Kokopelli's deliverables for our final project in CS3733 Software Engineering. The application is an AWS hosted website that allows for users to create venues and shows for customers to find and purchase tickets.


1. The Time is in EST
2. As a consumer when searching for venues the name of the venue will not show up but the shows inside of the venue will show up.
3. If nothing happens, click the button again, sometimes the button updates slowly 
4. In some situations, such as creating a show, the action can be verified through generating a show report, not pop up.
5. You must be logged in for most of the functions in the websites to work. This is due to the application keeping track of which venue manager has authority over which venue
6. Venues canâ€™t have the same name.
